# Text Summarization with Hugging Face Transformers

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of text summarization using Hugging Face Transformers. It leverages state-of-the-art pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks to generate concise summaries of input text.

## Features

- Utilizes Hugging Face Transformers library.
- Supports multiple pre-trained models for text summarization.
- Easy-to-use interface for summarizing text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
Customize the summarization model by modifying the model_name parameter in the summarize_text.py script.
Adjust summarization length by changing the max_length parameter.
